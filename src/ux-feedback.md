# UX Feedback

* Consistent Wording: Mix of German & English
  * Content is mixed: "Kindergarden der Stadt Wien"
  * Table headers are German
  * "Kindergarden" is English, Paginator is English
* Buttons
  * Overall a variety of different button types, often not obvious that they're even buttons.
* Responsive design: Image Scaling
  * Text scaling ok, but the Kindergarden App image does not scale
* Responsive design: Mobile view
  * In mobile view, for some reason the navigation disappears.
* Responsive design: Table
  * The table does not scale to mobile view, also is not centered. Currently, it's still a basic table, as grid was not required for Ex. 1.
* General appearance / Navigation
  * The navigation buttons currently aren't really apparent that they're part of a menu, they're somewhat disappearing in the background.
* Accessibility: Alt attribute
  * The Kindergarden image does not have an 'alt' attribute
